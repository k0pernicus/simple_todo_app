# SimpleTodoApp

A simple todo app to explore [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org), a web framework made with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

To start this app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
